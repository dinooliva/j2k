Examples of translating Java code to Kotlin. Each Java example, FooJa.java, has a corresponding Kotlin example FooKt.kt,
demonstrating how the Java code could potentially be translated into Kotlin. Additionally, for each example, there is a
test, FooTest.kt, written in Kotlin demonstrating that calling the Java code and Kotlin code are the same from the Kotlin
perspective.
